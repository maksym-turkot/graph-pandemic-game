# A graph-implemented game based on the popular board game Pandemic

The goal of the project is to create a simulation of a market and calculate certain metrics based on multiple runs of different configurations of the simulation (different numbers of different types of stalls, and their transaction speed).

## How to run the project
Run the `main` method in Controller class.

## Configuring the program
In the `data/maps/` folder user may find map files that are used to generate game boards.
