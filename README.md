# A Graph-Implemented Game Based on the Popular Board Game Pandemic

The goal of the project is to create a simulation of a market and calculate certain metrics based on multiple runs of different configurations of the simulation (different numbers of different types of stalls, and their transaction speed).

## How to run the project
